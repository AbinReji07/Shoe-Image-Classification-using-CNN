# Shoe-Image-Classification-using-CNN
This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify shoe images into categories. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on image data with preprocessing and augmentation to improve accuracy. It demonstrates deep learning in computer vision for fashion and retail.
